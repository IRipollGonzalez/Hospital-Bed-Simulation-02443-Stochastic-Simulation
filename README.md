# Hospital-Bed-Simulation-02443-Stochastic-Simulation
Discrete-event simulation project for DTU course 02443 – Stochastic Simulation. The project models patient flows across hospital wards under capacity constraints, introducing a new epidemic ward (F*) and optimizing bed reallocations via simulated annealing.
